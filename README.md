> 'convinced-brown-hop-at-South"
```

Different separator, prefix is Timestamp and 'the-end' string added to the end of the string
```ruby
separator = '*'
prefix = proc{ Time.now.to_i }
postfix = "the-end"
Phraser.generate_string(separator: separator, prefix: prefix, postfix: postfix)
> "1496842603*red*massive*elephant*the-end"
